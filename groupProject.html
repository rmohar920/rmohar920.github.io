  Aries Horoscope
SEP 25, 2019: A rapid exchange of ideas with a friend or coworker early in the day will stimulate your curiosity—you'll want to follow up on some of the ideas from the discussion, and should try to make time to do so. A quick internet search will help you find the answers you need and will plant more seeds for a continued conversation. While you might not be able to pick up where you left off with this person today, you will eventually. And when you do, you'll be ready.

   Sagittarius Horoscope
   SEP 25, 2019: Unenthusiastic people usually test your patience, but today your creativity is at an all-time high—so you are up for the challenge of turning something boring into something interesting! You can make this day an absolute blast, even if you're stuck in a boring situation with a bunch of folks who think talking about the weather is scintillating conversation. Use your imagination—it will make sure you're not bored, no matter how uneventful the day may be.

   Gemini Horoscope
   SEP 25, 2019: You'll have a great time meeting lots of people right now, so if you are going to be involved in group activities, get ready to press the flesh and get chatty with a lot of people. There are many, many social opportunities coming soon. Of course, not everyone will be as charming as you would like today, but they will all be interesting! By the end of the day, your energy will start to lag a bit—it can be exhausting to be so skillfully social for such an extended period of time!

   Virgo Horoscope
   SEP 25, 2019: It's an unusual day today, and your judgment might not totally accurate—you are likely to get caught up in the finer, mostly irrelevant details that don't have much to do with what you need to be focusing on right now. A friend's hot social life may be interesting, but hearing all about their latest fling isn't going to help you get done what you need to get done! Give yourself time in the morning to prepare your day and get a better grip on the forces around you.

   Cancer Horoscope
   SEP 25, 2019: Today is a surprisingly low-stress day that will provide you with a lot of time for your friends. Use this time to talk about your hopes, desires, and—as usual—the latest gossip. You may be surprised to learn that a major drama has been going on that you know nothing about! Don't waste any time in getting caught up on all the details, and don't forget to add that sparkling insight of yours. You may connect some exciting dots that no one else thought about.

   Capricorn Horoscope
   SEP 25, 2019: When discussing a conflict today, cut to the chase. Beating around the bush will offer up way too many chances to avoid dealing with what's really going on. It's like a Band-Aid: it's less painful if you get it over quickly. The balance between you work and your personal life has been especially tricky lately—so do whatever it takes to ease the tension today. One good idea is to put your career on the back burner so that you can turn all your attention on a relationship.

   Libra Horoscope
   SEP 25, 2019: A dual-natured authority figure is telling you one thing but doing another. Check in with them today to see what they've come up with. If they blow you off or stall for more time, then you might want to consider finding a new beneficiary for your cause. There is only so much this person can do, and they are probably worried about letting you down. Let them know you will go your own way if necessary. You've still got a few good tricks up your sleeve!
